%description
libunsn is a library providing functions to handle Universal Network
Socket Names (UNSNs).

UNSNs are a form of network address that does not discriminate in favour
of any particular networking protocol suite.  Applications that use
UNSNs can talk all protocols that the library knows, without having to
know about any protocols themselves.

UNSNs are a form of network address that does not discriminate in favour
of any particular networking protocol suite.  Applications that use
UNSNs can talk all protocols that the library knows, without having to
know about any protocols themselves.

This package contains the libunsn shared library only.  This is required
in order to run programs that use UNSNs.  In order to compile programs
that use UNSNs, you'll need the libunsn-devel package (or you can get
everything in one go with the libunsn-all package).

UNSNs are a form of network address that does not discriminate in favour
of any particular networking protocol suite.  Applications that use
UNSNs can talk all protocols that the library knows, without having to
know about any protocols themselves.

This package contains the libunsn headers and the static version of the
library.  This is required in order to compile programs that use UNSNs.
You'll also need the shared library in the libunsn-shlib package (or
you can get everything in one go with the libunsn-all package).

This package contains the libunsn shared library, the development files,
and a set of UNSN-using networking utilities.  This is exactly what is
in the libunsn-shlib, libunsn-devel and libunsn-utils packages, combined.
