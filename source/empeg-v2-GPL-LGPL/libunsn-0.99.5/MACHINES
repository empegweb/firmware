libunsn has been compiled and installed on the following systems.
If something isn't listed here, it doesn't mean it doesn't work, it means
it hasn't been tried (absence of evidence is not evidence of absence).

i586-pc-linux-gnu (Debian, Red Hat 5/6) [0.99.4]

	Compiles cleanly out of the box.  Compiles as a shared library.
	IPv6 is supported (if the kernel is so configured), with hostname
	lookup in glibc2.

i686-pc-linux-gnulibc1 (Slackware) [0.99.2]

	Compiles with some harmless warnings about missing prototypes in
	kernel headers.  Compiles as a shared library.	IPv6 is supported
	(if the kernel is so configured), but with no hostname lookup.

sparc-sun-solaris2.6 [0.99.4]

	Compiles cleanly out of the box.  Compiles as a shared library.
	IPv6 is not supported (it will be in Solaris 8).

hppa-hp-hpux10.20 [0.99.4]

	Compilation problems due to h_errno not being defined.	Also
	warnings due to configure giving making socklen_t the wrong type.
	Should compile as a shared library.  The native make barfs on
	the Makefiles; GNU make must be used.  Possibly some issues with
	hostname lookup.
