What this is
------------

Linux USB driver for empeg-car players. This can be used in
conjunction with "emptool" in order to upload tunes and organise the
database (see end of this text).

This driver is released under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (GPL). Refer to the file "COPYING" for details.

Changes
-------

0.10	- First release.
0.11	- Removed throttle/unthrottle handlers, which is a workaround for
	  uhci/ohci driver bugs causing occassional lockups and slower
	  zmodem transfer rates.

Requirements
------------

This driver has been written with Linux 2.3.39, but it seems to also
work with 2.3.37. The rapid development of USB in Linux means that
you're best bet is to obtain the latest kernel if you encounter any
problems - but on the other hand, a newer version of the kernel may
break this driver... An OHCI based USB controller was used for
testing, but the code is not dependent on this.

You will need a device called /dev/empeg-car0 created as such:

cd /dev
mknod empeg-car0 c 240 0
chmod 666 empeg-car0
ln -s empeg-car0 empeg-car

This creates a character device on node major 240 minor 0, which
according to Documentation/devices.txt is reserved for local and
experimental use. If you need to use a different node, the relevant
bits to change are near the top of empeg-car.c. If you want more than
one empeg (lucky you!) create another with minor 1. Not that I've
tested it with more than one empeg (attempt at your own peril!)

Notes
-----

I've had to use a rather ugly hack to get tty_flip_buffer_push(tty) to
work in a useful way. I'd like to know a nicer way of doing this
without having to set it low_latency and directly accessing the
flip_count variable.

"emptool" is using a rather small buffer for use with USB, but it
doesn't seem to impact performance much.

Installation
------------

1) Edit the Makefile to suit your system (you probably won't need to).

2) Run "make". This just builds the module.

3) Run "make try". This builds the module (if necessary), removes any
old empeg-car module and insmod's a the new one.

From now on, you can access the empeg-car's USB on /dev/empeg-car as
if it were any normal tty (provided you followed the steps in
'Requirements'). This means you can run emptool with:

emptool /dev/empeg-car

Enjoy!
