-----------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR BETA 9 AND LATER (emptool 0.81 and up)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The client-player protocol interface has had some changes which mean
that a beta 9 (or later) client will not work on a beta 8b player, and
a beta 8b client will not work on a beta 9 (or later) player. If you
get messages such as:

"Protocol version of emptool is too old for your player"
or
"Protocol version of your player is too old for emptool"

then the versions are incompatible. Obtain a current image and
apply it with 'upgclient', and then run the enclosed emptool.

Also note that the new 'upgclient' should be used for upgrade files
from Beta 8b releases onwards. So, in either case, you should
definitely use the new 'upgclient' binary.

-------------------------------------------

This package contains emptool, the linux empeg-car uploader, and
upgclient, a tool for upgrading releases on the player.

Please refer any bugs to bugs@empeg.com.

emptool
-------

To get a brief list of usage for emptool, run the program without any
options. This will bring up the default help text. To start emptool if
the player is connected to your first serial port, run it with

./emptool /dev/ttyS0

A more detailed overview is found in the manual page included in this
package. This is called 'emptool.1' and can be viewed with GNU man with

man ./emptool.1

or copied to your /usr/man/man1 (or /usr/local/man/man1) directories
and viewed with

man emptool

New for version 0.81:
 - - - - - - - - - -

Added -e and -l options for most commands. Using -e makes all titles
that are printed as output escape any spaces with a backslash-space
sequence, e.g:

		/Long title name
	becomes
		/Long\ title\ name

The -l option prints a node in 'long' style, e.g:

     970 playlist /Fatboy\ Slim                                              23

The fields are, in order: FID node number (hex), type (playlist or
tune), title and length. The length for playlists is the number of
entries. For tunes, this is the length of the file itself.

Filesystem check progress is now reported!

New for version 0.80:
 - - - - - - - - - -

- Completely overhauled entire program. Syntax has changed for 'set',
'unset' and 'ls' - please refer to man page. Features missing:

  - 'ls' doesnt show any file details (length, type etc)
  - Some progress reports are repeated twice (e.g "Downloading")
  - Can still ctrl-c the program at 'unsafe' points (at any point)

- Numeric codes for most operations. Script writers will probably want
to look at "numerics.h" which is taken straight from the
source. Numerics are output as 4 digit numbers at the start of a
line. Run emptool to see what the format is :) Beware that the codes
may change with new releases (hopefully won't have to).

- The '$' '^' '#' '#begin' '#end' symbols are currently unimplemented!
This means if you have two identifiers with the same name, you can't
access them properly.

upgclient
---------

Usage is fairly self-explanatory. To upgrade a player on your first
serial port with the file "developer-beta8c.upgrade", use

./upgclient -p /dev/ttyS0 developer-beta8c.upgrade

Help text is shown when run without arguments.

Known problems:

- Baudrate setting is possible, but the player only supports 115200.
